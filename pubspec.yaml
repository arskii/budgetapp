  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/cigun.jpg
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/index.json

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: BebasNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/BebasNeue-Regular.ttf
       
          weight: 700
    
    - family: Jost
      fonts: 
        - asset: fonts/Jost-Regular.ttf
  
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
